# spam-checker

In this project, I created a spam/ham checker for text using machine learning that first reads the inputed text and then based on a series of features unique to the text will output a prediction on whether or not the text is spam. 

By first using a sample of spam/ham data given in the sql file, I converted features such as having links, having spam-like words, and the length of text into a csv file. This csv file was then ran through WEKA, a machine learning algorithm, to generate a decison tree. Based on the decison tree model generated by the csv data, my spam/ham checker makes predictions based on its various branches. 

Note: this project was completed using the local server environment MAMP
